## 1.0 Project Management Documentation
### 1.1 Project Aims
For this project I am aiming to create a first person perspective version of Pacman with a horry spin to it. I will adapt the original version of pacman by adding some features to reboot the game by giving it a more current feel to it, this will include the addition of a multiplayer ability, a first person perspective, option for VR and a horror style to it to make it feel unique.
#### Aims:
1. Create a FPS Pacman
2. Create a Horror styled pacman experience
3. Make the game mulitplayer compatible
4. Develop the ability to allow players to play with a VR headset.
#### Detailed Aims:

### 1.2 System Requirements
In order for me to complete my project i will need to make sure that certain system requirements are met. 

The first requirement is that i am going to need access to the software Unity in order to develop my game, unity is a advanced development software which is used by many different video game companies. 

The second requirement is system specifications, in order to smoothly develop the game and make sure that i dont have anything throttlenecking my development of the game. 

The third requirement is the internet.

The fourth requirement is a VR headset is players want to play in that mode.
### 1.3 Software Investigation
In order to develop my game successfully i will need to learn how to use some features and techniques to best develope the game. as i have only used unity for a few hours i am not skilled enough to fully create a game without first taking time to develop my own understanding and abilities.
### 1.4 Cost
For this project there are a few cost which are used in order for me to develop my project. The first and main cost is **Unity Pro licence**(£125 per month), Unity pro licence will allow me to use specific tools and abilities that the free version would not. By purchasing this license it will allow me to not be stopped by the software, meaning the only thing theoretically that could hold me back would be my own creativeness.

Another form of cost could be my system that i use at home for work and pleasure. the system itself costs around £1600 and thats including the monitors and peripherals. The system I have is a bit overkill for developing games and applications however it will be able to handle anything that is thrown at it during the development of the game.

The Internet used at my home costs around £50 per month is is a mandatory cost that is needed to upload work to the cloud so that i can access it anytime, also any research also requires the internet, this could be video tutorials or even just online documentation to help understand the software or a process.

Overall the total cost comes to just over **£2000**, This is because it will take around 3 months in order to complete the project, this menas i need to pay for internet and unity pro licence for that time on top of the cost of my system.
